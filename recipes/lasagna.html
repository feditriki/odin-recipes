    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>Lasagna is a hearty, comforting Italian dish that layers tender pasta sheets with savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melted cheese. Baked until bubbling and golden, it's a crowd-pleasing favorite perfect for family dinners or special occasions.

    The combination of flavors—from the richness of the meat and tomato sauce to the silkiness of béchamel and the gooey goodness of mozzarella—makes each bite irresistibly satisfying. This classic lasagna recipe sticks to tradition while offering room for personal touches or variations.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>

        <li>9/12 lasagna pasta sheets</li>
        <li>500g ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>400g canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups béchamel sauce</li>
        <li>200g shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>250g ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>50g grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the meat sauce</h3></li>
        <p>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Sauté onion and garlic until softened. Add ground meat and cook until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. Let it simmer for 20–30 minutes.</p>
        <li><h3>Make the bechamel sauce</h3></li>
        <p>In a saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Stir in 2 tablespoons of flour and cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in 2 cups of milk, and stir until thickened. Season with salt and a pinch of nutmeg.</p>
        <li><h3>Preheat the oven to 180 C</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Assemble the lasagna</h3></li>
        <p>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce. Add a layer of pasta sheets, then béchamel sauce, a few spoonfuls of ricotta (if using), and mozzarella. Repeat layers until ingredients are used up, ending with sauce and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan.</p>
        <li><h3>Bake the lasagna</h3></li>
        <p>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake an additional 15–20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</p>
        <li><h3>Let it rest then enjoy</h3></li>
    </ol>
